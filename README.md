# Comprehensive-Real-Estate-Analytics-with-Machine-Learning

Description: This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict trends in the Dubai real estate market. Using a dataset of property listings, the project explores property quality classification, price prediction, and clustering insights to provide actionable analytics.

# Introduction: 

This project offers a wide variety of properties with diverse attributes. It aims to:

Predict property quality based on features like size, number of rooms, and amenities.
Analyze price trends and predict property prices.
Perform clustering to group properties into meaningful categories.
The project uses Python, Scikit-learn, PySpark, and SparkML to preprocess data, implement machine learning models, and generate insights.

# Features: 

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and encoding data for machine learning models.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights through visualizations such as heatmaps, scatterplots, and bar charts.
3. Machine Learning Models:
4. Classification: Logistic Regression, Random Forests
5. Regression: Linear Regression, Lasso Regression
6. Clustering: K-Means Clustering
7. Dimensionality Reduction: PCA
8. Distributed ML: Applied PySpark to scale machine learning models for large datasets.
9. Performance Evaluation: Accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and visualization of results.

# Technologies Used: 

1. Python: Core programming language.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation.
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization tools.
4. Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
